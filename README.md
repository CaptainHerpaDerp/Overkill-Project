Assymetric Battle game where you need to win by painting the most ground in your color. Each of 4 playable character has its own way of spreading color and active ability emphasizing specific playstyle. In addition creatures behave according to their owner color.

Here are 2 showcases. Each additional player just adds an additional split screen. Actual fps in game is good, but there is lag due to recording.
